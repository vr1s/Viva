# this file has no code related to underlying functionality of the tweak in it, but instead handles
# stuff that fit nowhere else. All code that'd be remotely valuable to developers was moved into other files
#   that i have open sourced. As this file contains 'sensitive' information I can't include it currently.

# The tweak probably can't run from this source code without it, but having the open source code be buildable *is* an end goal of mine.
